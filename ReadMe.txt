I did wrote this script to use it as plugin for NirSoft "Total Network Inventory" for adding remote access feature with VNC.
Note, that nowdays VNC is agreed to be outdated.
It could be launched separetely, and requires only TightVNC software or other similar, wich is free for personal use.
This visual basic script is intended for remote installing and connecting to windows boxes with VNC protocol.
For installation process, script uses windows remote procedure call service, so mentioned service should be functional.
Script requires domain administrator rights on remote computer, and asks no password during installation or connection.
